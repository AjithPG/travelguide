				<p><strong>Malampuzha</strong> is a village in Palakkad district of Kerala, South India, near to the Malampuzha Dam.Malampuzha Dam is located eight km from Palakkad town. It was built in 1955 and the garden was renovated recently. The main attractions are the suspension bridge, the cable car ride and the Fantasy Park. There are several gardens including one cute Japanese garden. The Yakshi statue of Kanayi Kunhiraman is also reputed even though the nudity of the structure is not approved by the conservative society of Kerala. The dam is accessible by bus and the last bus returns to town by 8.00 pm. The nearest railway station is Palakkad Junction which is otherwise known as Olavakkode
					Malampuzha, about 10 km from Palakkad, is a famous picnic spot, the biggest dam-garden of Kerala. This is a large irrigation dam built on the river Bharathapuzha at the base of the hills of the Western Ghats. Started in 1949, the dam was commissioned in 1955. The capacity of the dam is 115.06 m (375.15 ft).
					Around the dam there are beautifully landscaped gardens, with lush green lawns, well laid-out with flower beds, cool pools, fountains and pathways, a rock garden and rose garden with over a hundred varieties of roses. Udan khatola, an aerial passenger ropeway across the garden, the first of its kind in South India, offers an air journey of 20 minutes at 60 ft. height across the gardens (on one of the 64 two-seater chairs with transparent hoods), giving a delightful panoramic view.
					'Yakshi', a concrete sculpture by Kanai Kunhiraman, decorates the garden. A well maintained swimming pool, a fresh water aquarium, a snake park, a children's park with a toy train are also available here. There is also a telescope tower providing a terrestrial view up to 40 miles away.
					The dam and garden are illuminated on Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays. On the other days they are illuminated on request for a fee.
					Boating and fishing facilities are available at the dam. One can hire a paddleboat, a rowboat, a water scooter or a motorboat. All with a stunning view of the green mountains surrounding the reservoir.
					Frequent bus services from Palakkad (06.00 - 20.00)</p>

				<h1>Palakkad Fort</h1>

				<p><strong>Palakkad Fort</strong>Palakkad Fort is an old fort situated in the heart of Palakkad town of Kerala state, southern India. It was built by the Raja of Palakkad in 1766 ACE and remains one of the best preserved forts in Kerala.The Palakkad Fort is said to have existed from very ancient times, but believed to be constructed in present form in 1766 A.D, but little is known of its early history. The local ruler, Palakkad Achchan, was originally a tributary of the Zamorin, but had become independent before the beginning of the eighteenth century. In 1757 he sent a deputation to Hyder Ali seeking help against an invasion threatened by the Zamorin. Hyder Ali seized upon the opportunity to gain possession of a strategically important location such as Palghat and from that time until 1790 the fort was continually in the hands of the Mysore Sultans or the British. It was first taken by the latter in 1768 when Colonel Wood captured it during his raid on Hyder Ali's fortresses, but it was retaken by Haider a few months later. It was recaptured by Colonel Fullarton in 1783, after a siege that lasted eleven days but was abandoned the following year. It later fell into the hands of the Zamorin’s troops. In 1790 it was finally captured by the British under Colonel Stuart. It was renovated and was used as a base for operations that ended with the storming of Srirangapatnam. The fort continued to be garrisoned until the middle of 19th century. In the early 1900s it was converted into a taluk officeNelliyampathi, 52km. from Palakkad town and about nine kms. from Nenmara, adjoins the Parambikulam wildlife sanctuary where leopards, elephants, bisons and deers abound. It is an enchanting hill station at an altitude of 4,000 ft. (467 to 1572 m) above sea level, in the midst of the majestic Western Ghats, where mountains and valleys are interspersed with tea, coffee, cardamom and orange plantations. The total area is about 82 sq. kms.
					The highest peak in the range is Nellikotta, also called Padagiri, 1585.08 m above sea level. The other major peaks are Vellachimudi, Valiyavana, Mayanmudi and Vela Vanchan, each about 1200 m. high.
The annual average rainfall in the area is 47.244 mm. The temperature varies between 15 C in December and 30 C in April, the mean temperature being 22 C. This hill station, despite its natural beauty and excellent weather conditions, has not yet been exploited much by modern urbanization.
The journey to Nelliampathi itself is an experience. The only route is from Nemmara, from where the first town of Nelliampathi, namely Kaikatty junction, is at a distance of 26 km. At the 9th kilometer is the Pothundi Dam, a small irrigation dam which provides water for the rice fields in the surrounding area. The dam is at the foot of the Nelliampathi hills. From here, starts the government forest, where one can see massive teak trees. The Ghat road winds up through the evergreen forests of the Sahya Ranges for the next 17 km, with breathtaking valley views. This road is very narrow, with many hairpin turns on the way, requiring a skilled driver behind the wheels. On the way, one can see wild animals like monkey, deer and porcupine. The view of the Pothundy dam from the height is a breathtaking sight. There will be many waterfalls ?by the roadside during the rainy season.
A trek through the Nelliyampathi forests may bright to the view groups of bison grazing in their habitat.
Seethakundu offers a fantastic panoramic view of the valley below, and you can see aboutone third of Palakkad. The 1000 m high waterfall is one of the major attractions.
Seethakundu got its name from the legend that Sita Devi, during the vanavasa period with Sri Rama, took a bath here. During Deepavali, a large number of devotees gather here.
